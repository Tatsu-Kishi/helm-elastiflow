### Repo

Due to circumstances I am unable to test any changes, therefore cannot feasably develop these charts further. PRs are welcome and will be pulled based on guarantees and visible checking only.

> NOTE: I do not guarantee that these charts work. Check all of the individual value files and potentially templates and adjust them depending on your environment!

### Chart

See HELM_README.md for use information. Original chart from here https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/elastic-stack

### License

Helm chart: Apache 2.0

Elastiflow: [Robert Cowart public licence](http://www.koiossian.com/public/robert_cowart_public_license.txt)

This chart does not contain code of Elastiflow, but references it and instructs to download the docker container published by Rober Cowart, which is subject to the Robert Cowart public licence.
See original comments and attributions in the files and source repos. Almost none of this work is mine and I lay no claim to any of this.
